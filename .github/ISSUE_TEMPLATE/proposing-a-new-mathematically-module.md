**Describe the proposed module**
(e.g., `ComplexSpectralNorm`, `ComplexWhitening2d`)

**Why is this operation mathematically valid in ℂ?**  
- [ ] Phase equivariant / invariant (specify)
- [ ] Compatible with Wirtinger calculus
- [ ] Does not treat ℂ as ℝ²

**Expected behavior and formula**
Please provide the mathematical definition and forward pass.

**Relevant papers**
(e.g., "Deep Complex Networks")

**Use case**
In which domain is this operation necessary? (e.g., radar, MRI, quantum-inspired nets)
